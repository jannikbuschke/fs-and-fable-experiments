### 1. Immutable data, expressions and statements
-   Immutability: How would we add up ten numbers ( 1 .. 10 ) without using Linq.SumBy / Seq.sumBy - and you can't use the mutable keyword. what do you do?
- Understand the difference between expressions + statements; how does it relate to mutability? how does it relate to the ignore function? what are the costs + benefits of expressions vs statements?

#### Problems of immutability
- for variables it can be harder to keep track of their current state,
- loss of data, by overriding we lose state, that might be valuable for debugging
- its harder to implement multi threading (shared state)
- Conflicting clients using shared state. For example a stateful object might be shared by different callers and they might not expect others to change the state.
- Can make objects (data+behavior) unpredictable/harder to work with

#### Benefitial properties of immutability
- One immutability result of making things immutable is that immutable things need to be initialised. This removes a frequent occuring class of bugs.

### Questions that arised when reasearching
- what actually is a symbol?

> This illustrates why F# doesn’t need a return keyword at the end of a function. Because everything is an expression, the last expression within a function must be the return value. Compare the original C# sample to F# and see the differences.

what is meant by "everything is an expression"? => maybe only in the local context everything was an expression (inside the function).



```fsharp
open System

//- Immutability: How would we add up ten numbers ( 1 .. 10 ) without using Linq.SumBy / Seq.sumBy - and you can't use the mutable keyword. what do you do?

// # 1

[ 1..10 ] |> List.fold (fun current next -> current + next) 0

// # 2
let rec sum list =
    match list with
    | [] -> 0
    | x :: xs -> x + sum xs

sum [ 1..10 ]

// Understand the difference between expressions + statements;
// how does it relate to mutability? how does it relate to the ignore function?
// what are the costs + benefits of expressions vs statements?
// statement? assignment

// statements:
// - statements or side effects in the end produce value to the user
// - statements are harder to test

// expressions:
// - are easier to test
// - are pure / always return the same value for the same input
// - are easier to reason about, as time is not a factor?
  

// Questions: How does a 'computation expression' relate to normal expressions?

// chapter 7 of isaacs book
// statements are
// - variable assignments and declarations
// - calling functions
// - looping through collections
// - branching
// -- usually have side effects
// -- return nothing/never


// C# is more statement based, it mixes statements and expressions. Expressions are more difficult to do in C# in general.

// expressions are
// - a sequence of 0 or more operands and 0 or more operators that evaluate to a single value, method, object or namespace
// -- usually have no side effects, return something always

// let bindings are immutable (if no mutable keyword is used). Values can also be functions
// immutable things are more predictable than mutable things

//statement
let f = "Hello World"

//statement
let rnd = Random()

// statement
rnd.Next()

// expression
5 = 5
